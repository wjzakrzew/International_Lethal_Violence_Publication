## ABSTRACT
The current article explores the relationship between institutional
imbalance (Institutional Anomie Theory) and the Stream Analogy of
Lethal Violence (SALV). The stream analogy proposes that both homicide
and suicide are generated by the same force of production while
different structural and cultural factors serve as the force of direction.
Using various cross-national sources, we hypothesize that institutional
imbalance is a force of direction, with stronger institutional
imbalance leading to more individuals committing homicide than
suicide. In addition, for exploratory purpose, we examine whether
the institutional imbalance is related to the force of production. Our
findings support neither of these hypotheses.
